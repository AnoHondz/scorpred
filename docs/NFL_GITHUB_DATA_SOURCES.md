# NFL GitHub sources: retain the existing backbone

Observed October 22, 2026 UTC / October 21 Eastern. Read with the [research method and scoring](SCORPRED_GITHUB_DATA_RESEARCH.md). No NFL outcome payloads were downloaded or queried; only local dataset/receipt metadata and upstream release metadata were inspected.

## What ScorPred already possesses

The live store has **90 dataset/season partitions across 28 dataset names**. Exact per-partition row counts, hashes and receive times are in [existing_inventory.json](assets/github_data_research/existing_inventory.json). Season support in a loader is not a claim that every season has been imported.

| Existing category | Local coverage | Measured limitation / immediate value |
|---|---|---|
| Schedules/results | 2022:284; 2023–25:285 each; 2026:272 rows | No need for another core schedule import. First four are closed historical scopes; future placeholders are not results |
| PBP | 2022–26; current 2026 metadata:16,380 rows | EPA/success already present. Current projection includes `no_play`; old stored-field audit is not a new verification. CPOE is not projected |
| Team/player game stats | 2022–26; 2026:176 team rows /6,131 player rows | Audit team feed covered 88 of 93 completed games; inspect the feed/derivation gap rather than add another source blindly |
| Derived team/QB games | 2022–26; 2026:160 team rows /187 QB rows | Derived from PBP; not an independent source. Their last derivation remains October 18 |
| Annual/weekly rosters, depth, injuries, snap counts | Mostly 2022,2024,2026 | Missing 2023/2025 local partitions; current observations mostly October 18, despite newer upstream releases |
| NGS passing/rushing/receiving | 2022,2024,2026 | Public weekly aggregates, not full player tracking. Newer combined release exists; historical availability still unproved |
| PFR passing/rushing/receiving/defense | Week and some season summaries; mostly 2022/24/26 | Specific missing partitions and current pass-season missingness; do not use final season aggregates within a season |
| FTN charting | 2022,2024,2026 | Existing data and loader; licence/definition gate before new adaptations |
| Participation | 2022 and 2024 | Historical 2023/2025 releases available; 2026 in-season release absent and not expected |
| Directories/crosswalks | 36 historical team entries;24,854 player entries | 36 is not the active-club count. Existing explicit IDs should resolve gaps; no heuristic name matching |

The code already supports offensive/defensive EPA, success, passing/rushing efficiency, explosive plays, third down, red-zone and QB aggregations. These must use previous eligible games, both sides where necessary and explicit play filters. Additional advanced matchup columns are not justified merely because a repository contains them. The historical research's 54 masked columns cannot be unmasked by discovering today's statistics.

Collection already has a single guarded owner, 240-second schedules, 21,600-second PBP and approximately 20-minute full-feature snapshots. Declared catalogue auxiliary intervals exist, but the observed collector does not own every auxiliary feed. A schedule/PBP success therefore does not make the roster/injury/NGS tables current. [Collector](../scripts/nfl_collector.py), [catalogue](../services/nfl_catalog.py), [diagnosis](NFL_DATA_DIAGNOSIS.md).

## Release freshness, code activity and historical availability

The current [nflverse organisation policy](https://github.com/nflverse#licensing) describes ordinary releases as CC-BY4.0 and FTN data as CC-BY-SA4.0. Preserve provider attribution, the exact licence version and release exceptions. Existing source-code licences are separate. Direct upstream scraping is not authorized by this research.

| Inspected release | Latest inspected asset update, UTC | Important distinction |
|---|---|---|
| [PBP](https://github.com/nflverse/nflverse-data/releases/tag/pbp) | 2026-10-21 14:35:34 | `play_by_play_2026.parquet` itself updated 14:35:32; this is file-version metadata, not an outcome read |
| [Rosters](https://github.com/nflverse/nflverse-data/releases/tag/rosters) | 2026-10-21 12:56:40 | Local 2026 rosters last received October 18 |
| [Depth](https://github.com/nflverse/nflverse-data/releases/tag/depth_charts) | 2026-10-21 12:53:37 | Newer schema uses timestamps rather than weekly snapshots from 2025 onward |
| [Injuries](https://github.com/nflverse/nflverse-data/releases/tag/injuries) | 2026-10-21 12:53:03 | Current asset existence does not prove an injury was published before an old kickoff |
| [NGS](https://github.com/nflverse/nflverse-data/releases/tag/nextgen_stats) | 2026-10-21 12:34:57 | Passing/rushing/receiving files contain multiple seasons; no full tracking stream established |
| [FTN charting](https://github.com/nflverse/nflverse-data/releases/tag/ftn_charting) | 2026-10-21 16:35:36 | Share-alike conditions and postgame availability require their own lane |
| [Participation](https://github.com/nflverse/nflverse-data/releases/tag/pbp_participation) | 2026-02-10 18:54:08 | Through 2025 assets; no 2026 file in the inspected manifest |

These long-lived release tags were created earlier. Their `published_at` values must not be substituted for latest data updates. [Machine-readable asset names, IDs, hashes where supplied and update dates](assets/github_data_research/release_manifests.json) retain the evidence without downloading the data.

The [official availability schedule](https://nflreadr.nflverse.com/articles/nflverse_data_schedule.html) describes recurring PBP/stat corrections, daily roster/depth/injury updates, weekly NGS aggregates and four-daily FTN/PFR publishing opportunities. From 2023 onward participation arrives only after the postseason. Its absence in-season is expected. Timestamped depth changes can help future availability reconstruction, but `dt` alone is not ScorPred's receive receipt. Historical revisions remain ClassB unless original availability is independently proved.

## Ranked recommendation

1. **Keep `nflverse/nflverse-data` (88/100).** One existing data family; selective missing-year completion and refresh ownership offer measurable benefit. No new core import.
2. **Keep `nflverse/nflreadpy` (81/100) as existing tooling.** Already integrated; do not count it as another dataset or upgrade dependencies without a separate compatibility review.
3. **Use `nflverse/nflverse-rosters` (80/100) as a producer/schema reference.** Consume its outputs via the current host/loader, not an independent scraping stack. `nflverse-players` likewise supports explicit identity investigation; its README warns against installing the internal package.

There are **not three independently recommended new NFL datasets**. nflfastR supplies definitions and already-consumed derived fields. nfldata standalone file rights were not established in inspected licence paths; use the licensed release boundary. The actual nfelo project supplies a different prediction implementation, not a missing-statistics solution, and is rejected under this task's no-new-model constraint.

Do not expand the frozen feature definition, recalibrate models, regenerate the study hash or consume any of the 109 sealed outcomes. Both outcome and derived-statistic routes must retain current guards, including new provider IDs. Final review remains a separately authorized offline action no earlier than March 1,2027.

## Gap matrix

The classification **reliable** below concerns audited identity/results within their measured historical scope; it is not a claim of uninterrupted current collection. Gains are proposed acceptance tests. New usable record counts and cross-provider match rates remain unknown because no import occurred. [Full NFL CSV](assets/github_data_research/nfl_gaps.csv).

|---|---|---|
| Historical schedules/results and core PBP | Already available and reliable | 2022–2026 stored;284/285/285/285/272 schedule rows, PBP all 5 seasons; Do not reimport valid core history; quantify schema/receipt gaps only |

| Automation restrictions | GitHub-hosted access subject to host limits; upstream collection permission is a separate gate. No scraper or upstream API query is approved by this inventory. |
| Rate limits | GitHub REST:60 unauthenticated requests/hour/IP; authenticated baseline 5000/hour, secondary limits apply. No universal raw/CDN quota or upstream NBA/ESPN authorized collection quota verified. |
| Historical availability | File/asset existence and declared season scope only; per-game completeness not measured without ingestion |
| Pregame timestamp reliability | Historical Class B at best: release/commit/mtime is not original pregame observation. New genuine receipts can establish prospective availability only. |
| Missing-data limitations | No repository verified |
| Existing integration /compatibility | not integrated; Source-specific adapter and isolated sport namespace; never replace an existing model input implicitly |
| IDs /overlap | provider IDs need explicit crosswalk; Not measured; reconciliation required before import, no novelty assumed |

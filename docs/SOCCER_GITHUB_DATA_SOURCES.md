# Soccer GitHub sources: results coverage versus event depth

Observed October 22,2026 UTC / October 21 Eastern. No match/event/lineup datasets were imported. A small competition-season index and repository file/commit metadata were inspected to establish scope. Current production predictions and the three supported leagues remain unchanged.

## Existing inventory and integrity prerequisites

ScorPred supports Premier League 39, Bundesliga 78 and LaLiga 140. The prior audit found 7,888 unique classifier fixtures dated 2021-08-08 through 2026-04-19, but all lacked league and original source-availability lineage. Its 47 varying inputs were mainly goals/results/form/venue/Elo/rest; five market, five xG and three referee columns were constant/unsupported. Their presence in a model signature is not measured data.

The audited cache had 1,348 events:1,260 completed and 88 scheduled. Prior 2025-start season caches had 374/380 EPL,300/306 Bundesliga and 374/380 LaLiga fixtures. That is 18 cached gaps against league capacities, not proof that the upstream sources omitted 18 games. Selected daily probes all agreed with cached identities, but were not universe reconciliation.

Stage 1 preserved the erroneous original `E0_2018.csv` and quarantined it by manifest: its 319 rows duplicated 2025/26. The new `matches_stage1.csv` has 2,599 unique records and zero duplicates; it was not promoted into a model. Genuine 2018/19 is still missing. Existing 2019–24 EPL seasons have 380 rows each;2025 raw data is partial at 319/380. Current input window, target-date and unsupported prop definitions were repaired and tested; new research must not treat those as unfixed source bugs. [Soccer audit](SOCCER_DATA_DIAGNOSIS.md), [Stage1 evidence](SCORPRED_STAGE1_REMEDIATION.md), [inventory](assets/github_data_research/existing_inventory.json).

## Results sources and actual maintenance

| Repository | Declared/manifest scope | Latest verified dataset-specific observation | Recommended use |
|---|---|---|---|
| [openfootball/football.json](https://github.com/openfootball/football.json) | Season directories 2010/11–2026/27; current folder includes `en.1`, `de.1`, `es.1` and five other league files | EPL2026/27 file last committed 2026-09-22; not a fresh October feed | CC0 historical fixture/result reconciliation and league/season labels; source rows still need completeness/identity validation |
| [openfootball/england](https://github.com/openfootball/england) | Historical/current English top-four-tier Football.TXT |2026/27 path last committed 2026-09-21; repository later pushed October 15 | Same-family upstream alternative; custom text parser and timezone checks required |
| [Fjelstul English Football](https://github.com/jfjelstul/englishfootball) |1888/89–2023/24; author reports 208,028 matches, teams, team appearances and end-season tables | Data-path commit 2024-05-26; not a current feed | Explicit CC-BY-SA4.0 historical lane, useful independent structure/team IDs for 2018 and promoted-club history |
| [footballcsv England](https://github.com/footballcsv/england) |1990 s–2020 s directories, latest 2020/21 folder |2020 s data-path last changed 2023-05-28 | Historical CSV convenience only; do not interpret recent README interest as an ongoing feed |
| [footballcsv Germany](https://github.com/footballcsv/deutschland) |1960 s–2020 s directories, latest 2020/21 folder |2020 s path last changed 2020-12-01 | Dated historical archive; cannot fill current Bundesliga gaps |
| [footballcsv Spain](https://github.com/footballcsv/espana) |2010 s and 2020/21 directories |2020 s path last changed 2020-12-01 | Dated historical archive; cannot fill current LaLiga gaps |

Folder ranges are manifest evidence, not independently recounted full seasons. The footballcsv READMEs expressly identify their data as 1:1 openfootball exports. They are not three independent sources of evidence and may contain partial final seasons. All those openfootball/footballcsv licences are CC0/public-domain dedications; Fjelstul requires attribution and adapted-work share-alike. Its `appearances` are **team-per-match**, not player minutes. Its final standings must never enter within-season pregame strength features. [Fjelstul licence/definition](https://github.com/jfjelstul/englishfootball#the-license), [openfootball update policy](https://github.com/openfootball/help).

Dates/names/results can strengthen chronological H/D/A reconstruction and league identity. They do not add possession, injuries, player events or xG. Keep 90-minute results distinct from extra time/shootouts and never create UTC kickoff times from date-only entries. Valid complete seasons should be left alone; import only an enumerated gap after conflict/identity checks.

## StatsBomb: selected event coverage, restricted use

The requested [statsbomb/open-data](https://github.com/statsbomb/open-data) redirects to [hudl/open-data](https://github.com/hudl/open-data). Its inspected `competitions.json` contains **80 competition-season entries**, not 80 complete leagues or seasons. The index's latest revision field is May 26,2026; it is revision metadata, not historical pregame publication proof. No 2026/27 entry for any supported league was found. [Exact80-row metadata export](assets/github_data_research/statsbomb_competition_seasons.csv).

| Supported league | Entries in inspected index | Critical limitation |
|---|---|---|
| Premier League |2003/04 and 2015/16 | No current season; an entry alone does not establish complete league-match coverage |
| Bundesliga |2015/16 and 2023/24 | Selected historical data, not a current Bundesliga feed |
| LaLiga | Selected seasons 2004/05–2020/21 plus 1973/74 | Uneven/selected match scope; do not assume every match or every club is represented |

Other entries include international tournaments, women's competitions and selected domestic competitions. They do not automatically expand the existing men's club-league prediction population. Events can supply provider-specific shot xG, passes, shots, cards/fouls, substitutions and lineups;360 exists only for selected matches. Event possession IDs are not a validated possession-time percentage. Actual lineups and events are postgame facts; they cannot be target-game pregame inputs.

The README highlights credit/logo requirements, but the actual **StatsBomb Public Data User Agreement** also restricts commercial exploitation and raw redistribution and requests user registration. Its text is a custom agreement, not an unrestricted CC-BY grant. Clause 3.1 contains a licensor-rights representation, but it does not remove usage restrictions. Any adaptation into public app outputs or training beyond the permitted scope needs a separate documented decision. Keep this a restricted isolated research candidate, not a production replacement. [Agreement PDF](https://github.com/hudl/open-data/blob/master/LICENSE.pdf), [retained licence hash/text](assets/github_data_research/technical_evidence.json).

No current complete free GitHub archive of injuries, suspensions or pregame announced squads for all three supported leagues was verified. A postgame lineup archive cannot fill that gap. Existing 31 roster files/932 players with zero cached injuries do not establish healthy squads.

## Additional candidates and rejected substitutions

[SkillCorner/opendata](https://github.com/SkillCorner/opendata) has recent dataset-path activity in September 2026, but its current sample is 10 Australian A-League 2024/25 games with tracking/events and aggregate context. It is useful format research, not new EPL/Bundesliga/LaLiga coverage. [Metrica samples](https://github.com/metrica-sports/sample-data) have three anonymized example games, last addition 2021; comprehensive reuse permission was not established in the inspected files. Neither supports a reliable target-population H/D/A evaluation.

The explicitly requested `andrewbaisden/football-data` returned 404. No season coverage, licence or maintenance was verified, and it is not silently replaced by the similarly named football-data.co.uk service or an unrelated author's repository. Existing football-data.co.uk acquisition restrictions from the original audit remain unresolved; a GitHub mirror would not automatically cure those terms.

## Ranked recommendation

1. **openfootball/football.json,71/100:** easiest bounded three-league historical reconciliation, but current folder is too stale for a live fallback claim.
2. **Fjelstul English Football,67:** strongest additional historical English identity/structure candidate, subject to share-alike compliance and source-specific team-lineage conventions. Old lower-tier games are not automatically useful modern top-tier examples.
3. **openfootball/england,66:** upstream same-family historical cross-check; use where it supplies a specifically measured gap rather than a duplicate JSON import.

footballcsv scores 55 as historical format mirrors. StatsBomb scores 58 technically but has a different licence/population scope; it is not promoted above a permission gate because it contains deeper columns. There is no unconditional current event/xG/injury replacement for the three leagues.

Reconstruct league/season identity first, then measure duplicate/conflict/unmatched counts. Only later propose a controlled experiment on the existing H/D/A method, with all classes, calibration-bin denominators, paired matchweek uncertainty and an untouched final period. More rows or xG columns alone do not validate accuracy.

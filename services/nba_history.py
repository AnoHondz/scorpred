"""Full ESPN NBA box scores for the learned prop model, cached permanently.

Unlike services.espn_box_scores (compact rows for the rule model), each game keeps every
box-score column, the players listed out on ESPN's injury report, the players who did
not play, and the pregame spread and total when ESPN has them. Finished games never
change, so each event is fetched once. ``upcoming`` reads the same spread, total and
injury list for a game that has not started.

"""NFL player prop projections from local nflverse weekly player statistics.

Descriptive research only. Each market blends a recency-weighted current-season
mean with the player's previous season, scales it by what the opponent has
allowed to that position, and converts it to a full distribution so any line
can be priced. Only games played before the target week are used. Sportsbook
comparisons are attached separately by services.prop_markets, without changing
this model or its historical-target ranking.

"""Best player props of the day across soccer, NBA and NFL.

Each sport's existing prop model picks up to five props per game. This board collects
every pregame game on the day's slate and ranks by edge: how far the model's chance
exceeds the player's own recent hit rate at that line, the information the model adds
beyond the obvious. Ranking by chance alone would fill the board with near-certainties
(a defender under 0.5 shots on target) that no bookmaker prices usefully. Picks must
still be at least ``MIN_CHANCE`` likely, and each player appears once.

NBA and soccer chances were backtested at these lines (each player's recent median) and
are compared in one overall list. NFL props are experimental and never backtested, so
they are listed separately and never mixed into the overall ranking. A line is a
sportsbook's only when ``line_source`` says so; otherwise it is the player's own median.

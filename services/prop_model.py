"""Shared count-stat prop model for box-score sports (NBA, soccer).

For each player and market: a recency-weighted rate per minute, shrunk toward the
position's league rate; projected minutes from recent games; an opponent factor from
what the opponent has allowed per game, shrunk and capped; and a negative binomial whose
overdispersion blends the player's own history with a market default. The line stands
in for a sportsbook's: the median over the player's recent games in their current role.
A pick is the side where the model most exceeds the player's record at that line.

"""Learned NBA player-prop means (LightGBM) over full ESPN box scores, priced as negative binomials.

The rule model in services.prop_model projects each stat from the player's own recent rate.
This model also sees shot volume (field-goal, three and free-throw attempts), minutes
stability, rest and back-to-backs, teammates and opponents listed out on ESPN's injury
report, team and opponent pace, what the opponent allows to the player's position, and the
pregame spread and total. Every feature comes from games before tip-off.

``History`` is shared by training (scripts/train_nba_props_ml.py) and the live endpoint so
both build features identically. The trained artifact names the markets that beat the rule
model in walk-forward tests; only those are replaced, and every guard of the rule model
(current rosters, injury exclusions, minimum games, lines and records) stays in force.

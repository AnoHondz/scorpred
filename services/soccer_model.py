"""Published soccer probabilities: Elo plus Dixon-Coles ratings, combined by a fitted logistic layer.

Ratings are rebuilt from finished league results (ESPN team schedules, this season and the
two before it) and cached for a few hours. The combining layer's coefficients come from
``scripts/soccer_model_research.py``, which fits it on football-data.co.uk results with the
same rating code and reports its walk-forward accuracy against bookmaker prices.

The model is better calibrated than the rules engine it replaces but does not beat the
market (see docs/SOCCER_MODEL_RESEARCH.md), so it never produces a betting recommendation.

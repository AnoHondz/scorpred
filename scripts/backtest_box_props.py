"""Walk-forward check of NBA and soccer player props (services.prop_model) on a full season.

Each game gets exactly what the live endpoint sees: both teams' box scores from this
season and last, before tip-off. Players who did not play are void. Reports each
market's chosen-side calibration and Brier score against the player's own record, then
grades each game's five picks per market and fits the pick shrink on the season's first
half, checking it on the second.

Usage: python scripts/backtest_box_props.py nba 2026
       python scripts/backtest_box_props.py soccer 2025 eng.1
       python scripts/backtest_box_props.py nba 2026 --early   (only the first three weeks, normally skipped)
